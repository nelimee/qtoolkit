"""Implementation of the Group Leader Optimisation Algorithm.

This modules implements a modified version of the GLOA algorithm
presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2242.

The changes made to the algorithm were mainly done to restrict the
algorithm to a specific set of operations, called "basis" in the code.
This modification may not be profitable to the algorithm: the prior idea
of its inventors was to use a very large set of allowed gates and then
rephrase these gates with sequences of gates in the basis.
A simpler version of the algorithm may be useful.
TODO: implement the real algorithm to test accuracy and speed.

    :param unitary: unitary matrix we want to approximate.
    :param length: length of the resulting approximation sequence. The generated
        circuit will probably be simplifiable to a shorter quantum circuit, this
        parameter represents the length of the randomly generated quantum
        circuits, not the length of the simplified ones.
    :param basis: a sequence of allowed operations. The operations can be
        "abstract" (i.e. with None entries, see the documentation for the
        :py:class:`~.QuantumOperation` class) or not (i.e. with specified
        entries).
    :param n: number of groups used. See the article for a more complete
        description of the concept of "group".
    :param p: number of quantum circuit in each group.
    :param parameters_bound: bounds for the parameter(s) of the quantum gates in
        the basis. Bounds are specified as a sequence of 2-D numpy arrays. The
        first index (the index of the sequence) represent the gate concerned,
        i.e. parameters_bound[i] represents the bounds for basis[i]. For each
        gate, a bound is a 2-D numpy array. parameters_bound[i][0] is a 1-D
        numpy array with [parameter_number] floating-point values representing
        the lower-bounds of the parameters. Conversely, parameters_bound[i][1]
        is a 1-D numpy array with [parameter_number] floating-point values
        representing the upper-bounds of the parameters.
        If None, this means that no quantum gate in the basis is parametrised.
        If not all the quantum gates in the basis are parametrised, the
        parameter bounds corresponding to non-parametrised quantum gates can
        take any value (for example None).
    :param max_iter: maximum number of iteration performed by the algorithm.
    :param r: rates determining the portion of old (r[0]), leader (r[1]) and
        random (r[2]) that are used to generate new candidates. If None, the
        default value of the GLOA article is used: r = [0.8, 0.1, 0.1].
    :param correctness_weight: scalar representing the importance attached to
        the correctness of the generated circuit.
    :param circuit_cost_weight: scalar representing the importance attached to
        the cost of the generated circuit.
    :param circuit_cost_func: a function that takes as input an instance of
        QuantumGateSequence and returns a float representing the cost of the
        given circuit. If None, only the correctness will count and the circuit
        cost will be ignored.
    :return: the best QuantumGateSequence found to approximate the given unitary
        matrix.
